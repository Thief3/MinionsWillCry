Minions Will Cry
================

A game made a few years ago by myself and my friend in a minions themed weekend game-jam using Unity.

## Context

You're come to the sudden realisation that you're species is potentially the most irratating thing in the world. What's worse is that everyone is blind to them, due to an infectious mind numbing parasite they release to the world....

Time to clean up the mess. #minionsjam

## How to play

First, lower your volume, there was a bug in this game with sound. It is VERY VERY loud. 

Download the game at (https://gamejolt.com/games/minions-will-die/115855).

Left click in the direction you want to shoot, to shoot. Right click to throw a grenade (these are limited, you start at three.) Otherwise it's WASD to move.

Try to kill as many things as you can. Staying stylish and changing stuff around will make it much easier to beat your highscore.

Have fun minion slayer.
